    I have had a lot of joys and times when I thought I was going to give up
    during my gardening experience this summer!

  <ul id="lessons">
    <hi style="font-family: cursive;">Lessons Learned</hi>
    <li>The seedling starting and transplanting is the easy part</li>
    <li>There are repellants that actually work to keep deer and rabbits away!</li>
    <li>The hardest part of farming is bug control</li>
    <li>One has to be careful about some of the 'organic safe sprays' from
      the store,for bug control. They killed a lot of my plants!</li>
    <li>You have to have a passion for gardening to do it. It's a lot of
      work and I have enjoyed every minute of it!</li>
